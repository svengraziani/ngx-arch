<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>If you have not already created a new Angular project, you can do so by typing:</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="angularInstallation" [languages]="['shell']"></code>
</pre>
<p>
  If you need more information on this topic, you can visit the official
  <a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular CLI</a> documentation or read through
  <a href="https://angular.io/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular's Getting Started Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>Now that you have an instantiated project, you can install the Anglify package.</p>

<pre>
    <code [highlight]="archInstallation" [languages]="['shell']"></code>
</pre>

<p>Now you are ready to use NG Architecture Extensions.</p>
