<h1>Process Pattern</h1>
<p>The Process Pattern is a pattern that provides additional meta information about an observable stream.</p>
<p>It decorates the original data stream and wraps it into a simplistic pattern.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In the context of an "isLoading$" stream (Observable[boolean]), the primitive boolean does not provide enough information to handle an exact UI representation.</p>
<p>An HTTP Call may not only be loading or not-loading. For example, a stream could have errored or never started.</p>
